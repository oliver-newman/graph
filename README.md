# Adjacency List Directed Graph in Python

Reviewing my graph knowledge and trying out Python 3.

## Todos:
- [ ] Implement DFS (recursive)
- [ ] Implement DFS (iterative, using stack)
- [x] BFS with adjacency list
- [ ] Shortest path from node (Dijkstra)
- [ ] Minimum spanning tree
- [ ] Check for cycle
- [ ] Topological sort
- [ ] Count connected components
- [ ] Check for bipartite graph
